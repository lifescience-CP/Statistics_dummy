Once data are collected, the next step is to summarize it all to get a handle on the big picture.
Descriptive statistics are numbers that describe a data set in terms of its important features.
There are two main types of data: categorical (or qualitative) data and numerical (or quantitative data).
Categorical data record qualities or characteristics about the individual
Numerical data record measurements or counts regarding each individual, which may include weight, age, height, or
time to take an exam; counts may include number of pets, or the number of red lights you hit on your way to work.

The important difference between the two is that with categorical data, any numbers involved do not have real numerical meaning
(for example, using 1 for male and 2 for female), while all numerical data represents actual numbers for which math operations make sense

A third type of data, ordinal data, falls in between, where data appear in categories, but the categories have a meaningful
order, such as ratings from 1 to 5, or class ranks of freshman through senior.

Categorical data are typically summarized by reporting either the number of individuals falling into each category, or the
percentage of individuals falling into each category.

The most common way to summarize a numerical data set is to describe where the center is. what is the center tendency?

the mean (or average) and the median  # if mean > median, so what, if mean < median, so what

high outliers drive the average upward,Similarly, while outliers that are extremely low tend to drive the average downward.
